            <p>
                The Nicolesy Preset Previewer is a way for you to preview many of the <a href="https://store.nicolesy.com/collections/lut-files" target="_blank">LUT preset packs</a> in the Nicolesy Store with your own photographs before you purchase
                them.

                How do I get started?
            </div>
            <p>
                To get started, first you will need to create a user account. Then, click the upload button at the top of the page and select a file you wish to preview. After your photo is uploaded and processed, you will be redirected to a page
                where you can preview the Nicolesy LUT presets with your own image.

            <p>
                Yes! Any photo you upload here will only be used on this site for you to preview the preset packs. I do not and will not use your photos without your permission. Also, each time you upload a photo, the previous image is deleted and
                removed from the database.
